  "description": "<p>\"You are hereby sentenced to live the remainder of your life in the Underway Stockade, which, I hasten to add, is a blessing compared to the horrors of your crimes.\"</p><p>Everyone in Gethamane knows someone who has heard those words during sentencing. Everyone knows someone who has never returned from that dark, evil place. It was a death sentence yet one without the political stains of actual ordering an execution.</p><p>Recently, the prison has gone dark. No reports are being received by the government, no mail is ever answered, the door not opened for anyone, only for the condemned.</p><p>Today, another load of condemned souls is being carted to the prison. Among them are five individuals, devout servants of the realm. They were sent by the government of Gethamane to investigate the Underway Stockade's silence by infiltrating it as inmates.</p>"
